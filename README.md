# Mental-Health_machine-learning

Mental health is one of the most researched and insightful research areas. There is ample amount of data that can be collected for mental health and lots of differnt ways of obtaining that data.

This dataset is from a 2014 survey that measures attitudes towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace. You are also encouraged to analyze data from the ongoing 2016 survey found here. This machine learning project aims to find out if the dataset can be used to build classifiers and find out which classifier model is the best for classifying whether a pateient requires treatment or not.

The dataset can be found on this link: https://osmihelp.org/research

The attributes I will be studying for the classifier models are: 'Age', 'Gender', 'family_history', 'benefits', 'care_options', 'anonymity', 'leave', 'work_interfere' Timestamp
